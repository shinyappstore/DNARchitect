# DNARchitect: Explore Genomic Spatial Interactions

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/DNARchitect](https://shinyappstore.com/a/DNARchitect)__

DNARchitect is an application designed for visualizing HiC and chromatin conformation-based contacts at both high (Kb) and low (Mb) genomic resolutions. Chromatin conformation refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in the cell nucleus, influencing gene regulation. Users of DNARchitect can upload their pre-filtered HiC experiment in bedpe format to the web app, either on the hosted platform or a self-deployed version. This facilitates visualization of diverse interactions within the sample and enables users to conduct simple network analyses. Additionally, DNARchitect supports the visualization of other genomic data types. Users have the option to download their results for further analysis using external network-based programs such as Cytoscape. DNARchitect proves to be a valuable tool for researchers exploring genomic spatial relationships and interactions at different resolutions. Published: Ramirez et al.
